# Example #

This is an example of [material-responsive-grid](https://github.com/STORIS/material-responsive-grid) being used in a very simple React application.  

This application uses [webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) to load the CSS that is produced when this library is built.

To build the *material-responsive-grid* library:

```
npm run build
```

Before attempting to run the example application, install the dependencies:

```
cd examples
npm install
```

From within the *examples* directory, run the application:

```
npm run start
```
