# Example #

This is an example of [material-responsive-grid](https://github.com/STORIS/material-responsive-grid) being used in a very simple React application.  

This application uses [webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) to build and load the CSS.

To run this example:

```
cd examples
npm run start
```
